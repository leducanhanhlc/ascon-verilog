# Hardware Design of [Ascon-AEAD128](https://ascon.iaik.tugraz.at)

[Ascon](https://ascon.iaik.tugraz.at) is a family of authenticated encryption and hashing algorithms designed to be lightweight and easy to implement, even with added countermeasures against side-channel attacks. Ascon has been selected as new standard for lightweight cryptography in the [NIST Lightweight Cryptography competition](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2023/02/nist-selects-lightweight-cryptography-algorithms-protect-small-devices) (2019â€“2023). The current draft standard of Ascon is available [here](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-232.ipd.pdf).

## Available Variants

- **v1**
  - Ascon-AEAD128 + Ascon-Hash256.
  - 32-bit block data interface.
  - 1 permutation round per clock cycle.

## Interface

The interface of the Ascon core is similar to [GMU's crypto core interface (Figure 5.1)](https://cryptography.gmu.edu/athena/LWC/LWC_HW_Implementers_Guide.pdf) that was often used during the [NIST standardization for lightweight authenticated encryption](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/lightweight-cryptography/).
The following changes to the GMU crypto core interface were made:
- Removed signals:
  - `bdi_valid_bytes`, `bdi_pad_loc`, `bdi_size`
  - `fdi_ready`, `fdi_valid`, `fdi_data`
  - `fdo_ready`, `fdo_valid`, `fdo_data`
  - `bdo_valid_bytes`, `end_of_block`, `key_update`
- Renamed signals:
  - `decrypt_in` -> `decrypt`
  - `hash_in` -> `hash`
  - `msg_auth`, `msg_auth_valid`, `msg_auth_ready` -> `auth`, `auth_valid`, `auth_ready` 

The resulting (simplified) interface of the Ascon core is shown here:

The following table contains a description of the interface signals:

You can have a look at `rtl/tb.sv` for an example of how the Ascon core interface can be used.

## Quick Start

- Install the Verilator open-source verilog simulator with **version >= 5.0**:
  - Ubuntu:
    - `apt-get install verilator`
  - Fedora:
    - `dnf install verilator`
    - `dnf install verilator-devel`
  - Build from source:
    - [Git Quick Install](https://verilator.org/guide/latest/install.html#git-quick-install)
- Execute verilog test bench:
  - `make`
  - Runs `rtl/tb.sv` using the **v1** variant of the Ascon core and `tv/tv.txt` as input.
  - For other variants use `make v2` etc..
- Execute verilog test bench and show resulting waveforms:
  - `make wave`
  - Same as `make` but also opens the resulting `tb.vcd` in GTKWave.
  - For other variants use `make v2_wave` etc..

## Automatic Generation and Execution of Test Vectors

- `python run_tb.py -s`
  - Generate a new `tv/tv.txt`, run `rtl/tb.sv` using **v1** of the Ascon core, and compare output to the Ascon software implementation in `ascon.py`.
  - For other variants add `-v 2` etc..
- `python run_tb.py -w`
  - Same as `python run_tb.py -s` except the entire process is repeated for many inputs with different lengths.
  - For other variants add `-v 2` etc..
