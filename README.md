# Hardware Design of [Ascon-AEAD128](https://ascon.iaik.tugraz.at)

[Ascon](https://ascon.iaik.tugraz.at) is a family of authenticated encryption and hashing algorithms designed to be lightweight and easy to implement, even with added countermeasures against side-channel attacks. Ascon has been selected as new standard for lightweight cryptography in the [NIST Lightweight Cryptography competition](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2023/02/nist-selects-lightweight-cryptography-algorithms-protect-small-devices) (2019â€“2023). The current draft standard of Ascon is available [here](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-232.ipd.pdf).

> [!NOTE]
> This is a work-in-progress hardware implementation of the Ascon family of lightweight cryptographic algorithms that is compatible with the current draft standard [NIST SP 800-232](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/232/ipd).
